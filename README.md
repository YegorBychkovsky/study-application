I created a study project using the given API: https://www.postman.com/aninix/workspace/genesis-front-end-school/overview
During the implementation of the project, I encountered a number of difficulties, including those not related to the technical part.
However, I will continue to finish this project, regardless of whether it will affect anything, as I am not used to dropping things in half.
At the time of writing this README, I have already done the following:
- Created 2 pages (Main page with courses & specific course page)
- I arranged everything in the way that was required in the task, but did not add pagination, and did not do an additional task, namely, did not implement the ability to play the video without sound when hovering over the image.
- Implemented all the necessary tasks, but did not implement the ability to save the progress of watching the video.
- Did not implement the picture in picture functionality
- Did not implement video speed changes.
- Also did not do these additional tasks:

- handle API errors
- mobile version;
- video loading animation;
- tests;
